### Lamp stack


1. Used Vagrant file and provisioners from this [source](https://github.com/iambryancs/vagrant-ansible-lamp)
1. Readme in the project repo is self-explanatory and worked straight on my dev laptop, and should be good enough for the demo.   
1. If we are happy, then we can just do this for lamp.

### TODO
1. Need to tweak few ansible bits, and bootstrap steps to validate VirtualBox Guest Additions, vagrant sharefolders etc. work  
1. Show how we can use the same provisioning and up the vagrant box in aws etc.
1. vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest . Run this to work around VirtualBox Guest Additions
